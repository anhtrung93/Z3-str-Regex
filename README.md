Z3-regex is a string theory plug-in built on the powerful Z3 SMT solver (http://z3.codeplex.com/). 
It was built on-top of Z3-str (https://sites.google.com/site/z3strsolver/). In addition to what Z3-str supports, Z3-regex also supports (see our documentation): 
+ Regular expressions 
+ Membership predicates 
+ High-level string operations that work on regular expressions such as Star(), Matches().
